          DermGPT
          <br />
          Is the only advanced AI powered tool specializing in dermatology.

          DermGPT allows dermatologists to ask questions in natural language and
          receive relevant, helpful answers â€“ just like they would with real-life
          colleagues.
          <br />
          We now have access to the complete National Library of Medicine,
          expanding our knowledge base to over 60,000 dermatology articles.
